# SPACE_INVADERS_GAME
Space Invaders Game (First Semester Project) This is my first semester project, which is a basic implementation of the classic Space Invaders game. The game was developed using C++ and utilizes the Windows API for graphical rendering.  Features: Game Mechanics: The player controls a spaceship that can move left and right and shoot bullets at alien invaders.  Graphics: The game utilizes basic 2D graphics like lines, rectangles, and ellipses drawn directly to the console using the Windows GDI functions (via the windows.h library).  Alien Waves: Aliens move across the screen in a wave pattern, and the player must shoot them down to win.  Bullets: Both the player's ship and aliens can shoot bullets. Collision detection checks if any bullets hit the aliens.  Installation & Running: To run the game on your machine, ensure you have a C++ development environment set up. If you encounter a blank screen in the console, run Visual Studio as Administrator. This is due to the use of windows.h for direct manipulation of console output, which sometimes requires administrative privileges to render correctly.  Controls: Arrow Keys: Move the spaceship left and right.  Spacebar: Shoot bullets.  Enter Key: Start a new game or continue from the main menu.  Escape Key: Pause or exit the game.  Notes: This is a first-semester project, showcasing the basic usage of programming and simple graphics using C++.
